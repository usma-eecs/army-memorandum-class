---

#. This memo is a demo.
#. The following text is taken from the [Pandoc User Manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).
	#. Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read.
	This principle has guided pandoc's decisions in finding syntax for tables, footnotes, and other extensions.
	#. There is, however, one respect in which pandoc's aims are different from the original aims of Markdown.
	Whereas Markdown was originally designed with HTML generation in mind, pandoc is designed for multiple output formats.
	Thus, while pandoc allows the embedding of raw HTML, it discourages it, and provides other, non-HTMLish ways of representing important document elements like definition lists, tables, mathematics, and footnotes.
	#. Paragraphs
		#. A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by one or more blank lines.
		Newlines are treated as spaces, so you can reflow your paragraphs as you like.
		If you need a hard line break, put two or more spaces at the end of a line.
		#. A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard line break.
		Note: in multiline and grid table cells, this is the only way to create a hard line break, since trailing spaces in the cells are ignored.
